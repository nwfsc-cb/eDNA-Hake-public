This repository supports the publication, "Environmental DNA provides quantitative estimates of Pacific hake abundance and distribution in the open ocean" by Shelton et al. It contains raw data, scripts for processing that data, code for estimating statistical models from that data, and code for post-processing those model fits. 

The primary scripts are found in the "Scripts" folder and begin with the numbers 01 to 05:

01_qPCR_analysis.R reads in qPCR data and estimates statistical models of hake qPCR.

02_acoustics_analysis.R reads in acoustic estimates of biomass density and estimates statistical models for hake biomass.

03_post_process_acoustics_Output.R processes the fitted MCMC object from the eDNA models, calculates summary statistics, and generates plots. The object needed to run this script is generated by the "01..." script.

03_post_process_acoustics_Output.R processes the fitted MCMC object from the acoustics models, calculates summary statistics, and generates plots. The object needed to run this script is generated by the "02..." script.

04_post_process_qPCR_Output.R processes the fitted MCMC object from the eDNA models, calculates summary statistics, and generates plots. The object needed to run this script is generated by the "01..." script.

05_compare_acoustics_eDNA.R compares a range of model derived quantities and compares information from the acoustics and eDNA analyses. The objects needed to run this script are generated by the "03..." And "04..." scripts.

The remaining .R and .stan files are called within the 5 main scripts described above.

Data used in the statistical models for eDNA and acoustics can be found in the "Data" folder with subfolders for eDNA and acoustics data. Each subfolder contains an excel file describing the contents of the .csv data files and a description of the information contained in the data columns.
